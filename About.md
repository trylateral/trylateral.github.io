The world faces an unprecedented challenge. 

We urgently need to decarbonise energy if we are to prevent catastrophic global warming. At the same time, we need to grow energy consumption in the developing world. Our energy must also be reliable, affordable and sustainable. There are many technologies that meet some of these objectives; I believe only nuclear power can meet all of them. 

Do you find that shocking? You're not alone. I only ask you give me a chance to explain. 

Take a look at my [blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/) or writing on [Medium](https://medium.com/@DavidWatsonBlog). Read positive stories about how nuclear can play its part in us reaching Net Zero. See how nuclear requires less mining and puts [less pressure on the land]({{ site.baseurl }}/rewilding/) than any clean alternative. Look at the [energy systems modelling](http://news.mit.edu/2018/adding-power-choices-reduces-cost-risk-carbon-free-electricity-0906) that shows firm, low-carbon sources like nuclear make deep decarbonisation more affordable. Look at [which countries have low-carbon electricity]({{ site.baseurl }}/twaddle-emissions/), and how they've achieved that. Think about how rich countries have a moral responsibility to bring clean, reliable and affordable energy to the developing world. 

If you do that and still think I'm wrong, then fair enough. Either way, please leave me a comment or get in touch with me by email or social media. I want to hear from you.

### Some of my work

I am the founder of Atomic Trends, a place for exploring what advanced nuclear will mean for the 21st century. Check Atomic Trends out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/atomic_trends) or on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/atomic_trends/).

Check out my writing about energy and climate (among other things) on [Medium](https://medium.com/@DavidWatsonBlog).

See me talk about the problem with [the way the nuclear industry brands itself](https://youtu.be/A7uLVqwlpn4?t=68).

Read my [letter in the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/c68c8538-1a71-11e9-9e64-d150b3105d21) in response to the cancelling of the Wylfa Newydd project.

Have a look at my interview [for the Sustainability Times](https://www.sustainability-times.com/environmental-protection/un-mass-extinction-report-highlights-urgency-of-decarbonization/) about the UN's 2019 species mass extinction report.
